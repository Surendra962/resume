                                    The SSV (Supportive Supervision Visit) checklist has been developed in DHIS2. As part of my role, I am responsible for maintaining the website, which involves carrying out maintenance tasks,
                                     adding geographies, creating new user accounts, modifying questionnaires, and updating records as needed. In addition, I train new program officers and MER (Monitoring and Evaluation) staff to use DHIS2 effectively.
                                      Through these responsibilities, I have gained expertise in using DHIS2.

                                    This tool has been designed specifically for ranking facilities based on various factors such as reporting on NCDs, TB, incentives provided, 
                                    and other parameters. The process involves normalizing the data, giving weightage to each parameter, and then calculating the ranking. 
                                    The entire process can be time-consuming, which is why this tool has been created to automate it. All you need to do is download the 
                                    required raw file from the government portal, upload it to the tool, and download the analysis report. The tool also provides the option 
                                    to download scores and other analyses.
